TASK 1 
The function processes each number in the array by squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers, resulting in [3, 4, 9, 16, 15, 36] for the input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].


TASK 2
The formatArrayStrings function forms each string in the strings array in accordance with whether the matching integer in the numbers array is odd or even. It changes strings to uppercase if the matching integer is even, and lowercase if it is odd. It checks if the lengths of the two arrays are equivalent before continuing.

TASK 3
The createUserProfiles function creates an array of user profile objects from two input arrays of names. Each profile object includes the original name, the modified name, and a unique ID.
